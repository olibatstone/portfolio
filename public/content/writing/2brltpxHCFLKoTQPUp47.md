Microcopy. Short bits of text that tell key things to people all on their own. A little note that says when a garden is open on a particular day, a text telling a seller their stock won't show because the site is down for maintenance, an error message screaming your password must contain a haiku. It's hard — this guide is about how to edit it. It's not about other text like button labels, brand slogans or long form articles.

### 1. Cut fillers

We must hook the reader. The more words, the weaker the message and chance of their attention. Axe these:

* very or really — used for emphasis but weakens the adjective

* might, may or could — commit, don't hedge your bets

* that — most of the time you can remove

* adverbs e.g. readily — they weaken the sentence

* please — if you've an action, please implies a choice

Cutting takes us from:

> Please use a very strong password that has 12 characters and may include an asterisk.

to:

> Enter a 12 character password with an asterisk.

### 2. Swap long for short

People used Saxon words before the Romans introduced Latin. They're easier to understand and shorter in characters:

* improve → better

* assist → help

* repair → fix

* purchase → buy

### 3. Check formats

Computer output isn't always easy to read, so use:

* worded dates over digits — 24 Sep over 24.09 — the variety in character height is a useful signal

* digits over words for numbers — 1 over one

* lower case am or pm over military time — it's how we talk, the difference in letter height makes for easier reading and people don't have to do arithmetic

> What time do you want to meet? Seventeen hundred hours ok?

### 4. Use active voice

Active voice states the action and who does it. It signifies ownership. And it's easier to relate because it's natural in speech — this strengthens the message.

Passive:

> Slack was broken by the parrot emoji.

Active:

> The parrot emoji broke Slack.

### 5. Use neutral phrases

Use neutral phrases to avoid excluding a diverse population:

* we understand you instead of we hear you, we see you or we'll reach out to you

* folks or all instead of guys or other gendered collectivisms

### 6. Be positive

If the message is negative, recruit or anticipate the reader's needs to add a positive spin:

> The website is down but you'll have access to your tools in 5 minutes

### 7. Avoid punctuation

Skip punctuation for simpler sentences if possible. A rogue comma can change the entire meaning.

### 8. Sandwich matters

There's too much stuff going on to remember things, so start with a key word or phrase. If there's a call to action, put it at the end of the sentence or message so they read it last.

This is a non-exhaustive list and only a guide — where a suggestion doesn't apply to your text, don't include it. Just make every word count.
