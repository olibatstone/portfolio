### Nick Carter, Head of Design

I worked with Nick in 2021 in different teams at Candide and in 2022 as my line manager.

> I have worked with Oli in a number of different contexts at Candide, most recently as his direct manager. \
> \
> Oli is a thoughtful and considered designer who maintains the focus on the user throughout his work. His ability to research, articulate and advocate for their needs has been central to the direction and development of our products during his time here. When embarking on new work he ensures the problem we are solving is framed correctly, even under tight time constraints. His thorough documentation of process has increased communication and knowledge sharing within a hybrid working environment. \
> \
> Oli is able to take the lead on projects across the entire process – from discovery to delivery – which has been invaluable during a time of strategic change and reduced capacity. Alongside this, he has a keen interest in personal development, seeking peer feedback and training to develop his skillset.\
> \
> Above all, he's a thoroughly nice chap and an asset to the team.

### Matt Benton, Senior Software Developer

I worked with Matt in 2022 in the same team at Candide

> I always have a great time working with Oli at Candide. He has a deep understanding of our customers, and uses that to design simple solutions that meet their needs. He consistently not only produces great designs, but brings the team along in his processes, effectively finding solutions to any time or engineering constraints. I'd recommend working with Oli to anyone.

### Giles Currington, Design Lead

I worked with Giles in 2021 in the same team at Candide

> Oli is great at distilling complex ideas down and explaining them in ways everyone can understand. His thorough and precise approach to exploring problems, framing opportunities, and creating solutions made him a joy to work with, and his empathetic, approachable nature mean he’s a natural advocate for the user, seeking feedback and input on concepts and prototypes early and often.
>
> His awareness of the importance of language in shaping an experience, and skill in writing and working with words and UX copy, lend his design work a clear, human voice. His deep understanding of UX best practices was integral to designing successful products that meet user needs, and he is a strong proponent of good design and research practice
>
> I would love the opportunity to work with Oli again, and know that he would be a stellar addition to any product team.

### Simon Safhalter, Team Lead - JavaScript Developer

I worked with Simon in 2018 in the same team at Masabi

> Personally, for me, as a Front-End developer, it's really important to have a good and nice designer to work with. The collaboration between these roles is crucial in order to be successfully developing the product experience, flow and interfaces in an effective and future-proof way. Oli was all that and more. Really nice person to work with, amazing design skills and understands very well the web development intricacies.

### Terry O'Brien, Senior Front End Developer

I worked with Terry in 2017 in different teams at NewDay

> I worked with Oli on several projects and he was a pleasure to work with. Being a front end developer, I needed to work well with Oli to transform his designs into working web pages. He was always thinking about the user to ensure they had the best experience throughout. It was refreshing to work with a designer who considered web accessibility ensuring colour contrast, font sizes, touch points and hover/focus states were included in designs.
